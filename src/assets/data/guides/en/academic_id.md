# Academic identity

You can request an academic ID card at [website of the Ministry of Education](https://academicid.minedu.gov.gr/).

Click on the **"REGISTER/ENROLL "** button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

> On mobile devices you will first need to open the sliding menu in the top left to find the **"REGISTER/ENROLL "** button.

At the login, select **"Undergraduate Student "** and use the username of the academic email and password provided.

The next screen has a summary of what will be sent to the service: Academic ID. If you are OK click **"Accept "**. If not, contact the Registrar's Office.

Read the terms and click **"Accept "**.

They will send a confirmation message to your email. Click on the link it contains to confirm that you are you.

Then check your details. For admission month select **"October "** and enter the photo for your academic ID.

Indicate where you would like to pick up your ID card.

Don't forget to **submit**. When you submit you will receive a registration number. It is a good idea to write it down. It will also email that it was received.

You can ask for the academic ID which also serves as a bus pass.

You can also change your phone number to a student number.

Each semester you have to register your courses in the [UniPortal](https://uniportal.ihu.gr/) service. In the first semester, courses are automatically registered for students by the registry.
