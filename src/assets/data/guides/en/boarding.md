# Feeding

To eat free of charge at the restaurant, you will also need your meal card.

You should look for a campus announcement on [student services announcement list](https://www.ihu.gr/anakoinoseis-foititikis-merimnas) because the process is in transition.

In future years, all applications will be made via a relevant [university's food card application page](https://sitisi.ihu.gr/). However, it is possible that some IHU campuses may not have gone into the system, and may request that documents are sent to an email address.

Identification must be done and then apply for a meal card, then a notification will be sent out.

Enter your username and password. 

If you are already logged in, you will be asked for a list of documents, which you can deliver online during the period of registration for feeding.
