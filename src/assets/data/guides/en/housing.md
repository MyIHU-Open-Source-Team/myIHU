# Housing

Individuals interested in living in the IHU Residence Halls should look for a campus announcement on the [student services announcement list](https://www.ihu.gr/anakoinoseis-foititikis-merimnas) because the process is in transition.

In future years, all applications will be made via the relevant [university housing application page](https://stegasi.ihu.gr/). However, it is possible that some IHU campuses may not have adopted the system yet, and may request that documents be sent to an email address.

Identification must be done and then apply for a housing card, then a notification will be sent out.

Enter your username and password. 

If you are already logged in, you will be asked for a list of documents, which you can deliver online during the housing registration period.

For the Housing Subsidy, following the respective announcement, you can apply for it on [the Ministry's website](https://stegastiko.minedu.gov.gr/).
